# Part 4 : bloglist

We created a backend for an app who displays a list of blogs.
In this exercices we used Jest to start learning and practicing testing for our apps. In this part we only tested our backend and some simple things.
We added user administration and tokens authentication for our app.

## Start the app locally

### Install dependancies

`npm install`

### Create a .env file with "MONGODB_URI=<YOUR-MONGODB-URI>" for connecting your app to the MONGO database, "TEST_MONGODB_URI=<YOUR-MONGODB-URI-FOR-TEST>" for connecting your app to the MONGO test database and "SECRET=<YOUR-SECRET>" for tokens.

### Launch the application with

`npm run dev`

Access the app with : http://localhost:3003/

### Launch tests with

`npm test`
