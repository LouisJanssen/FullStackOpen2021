# Part 3 : phonebook

In this exercices we created a backend for the phonebook app. We used Node.js and Express.js for the backend. The frontend is still React.js.
We stored the data with MongoDB and connected it to the app.
We deployed the app to the internet with heroku.

You can access the app with : https://arcane-river-67871.herokuapp.com/

## Start the app locally

### Install dependancies

`npm install`

### Create a .env file with "MONGODB_URI=<YOUR-MONGODB-URI>" for connecting your app to the MONGO database

### Launch the application with

`npm run dev`

Access the app with : http://localhost:3001/
